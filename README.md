# Baby Shark is Back

## Description
Welcome to the "Baby Shark is Back" project! This project was developed as part of the INF443 course. Our goal was to create an underwater 3D scene with a cartoon aesthetic. We utilized our accumulated knowledge throughout the term to develop this fun and educational project.

## Features
- **Boids Model for Sharks**: Sharks are simulated with repulsion, alignment, and attraction forces, creating realistic group movements.
- **Oscillating Shader**: Simulates the swimming motion of sharks and seaweed.
- **Collision Management**: Includes collision forces for borders, the seabed, and objects.
- **Bubble Effect**: Uses semi-transparent 2D textures and interpolation splines for trajectories.
- **Fog**: Applies a blue fog effect to simulate underwater immersion.
- **Terrain and Skybox**: Terrain modified with Gaussian bumps and a skybox for a coherent environment.
- **Immersive Camera**: First-person view for an immersive experience, with the option to switch to an external camera.
